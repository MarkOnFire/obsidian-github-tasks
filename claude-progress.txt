CLAUDE PROGRESS LOG - obsidian-github-tasks enhancement
================================================================================

Project: Per-note repository tracking for PARA method integration
Design Doc: DESIGN_DOC.md
Feature List: feature_list.json

================================================================================
SESSION 0 - 2025-12-10 - Initialization
================================================================================

COMPLETED:
- Analyzed existing codebase architecture (main.ts, settings.ts, github.ts,
  sync.ts, utils.ts)
- Reviewed PARA methodology documentation for context
- Created comprehensive DESIGN_DOC.md with:
  - Feasibility assessment (highly feasible)
  - Technical design for all new components
  - Sprint plan using orchestrator/agent framework
  - Backward compatibility guarantees
  - Upstream contribution strategy
- Created feature_list.json with 10 discrete features
- Created this progress log and init.sh bootstrap script

KEY DECISIONS:
1. YAML frontmatter for repo config (github-repo: owner/repo)
2. Section markers for safe content updates (BEGIN/END_GITHUB_MANAGED)
3. PARA-aware scanning (folder filtering, archive exclusion)
4. Preserve existing single-note mode for backward compatibility

ARTIFACTS CREATED:
- DESIGN_DOC.md (comprehensive design document)
- feature_list.json (work queue with 10 features)
- claude-progress.txt (this file)
- init.sh (development bootstrap script)

NEXT SESSION SHOULD:
1. Run init.sh to set up development environment
2. Read this log and feature_list.json
3. Begin F001 (Settings infrastructure) and F002 (GitHub client extensions)
   - These have no dependencies and can be worked in parallel
4. Update feature_list.json status as work progresses

HANDOFF NOTES:
- Codebase is clean, well-organized TypeScript
- Build with `npm run dev` for watch mode
- Test in Obsidian by reloading plugin after build
- Existing tests: none configured (manual testing only)
- Key pattern to preserve: ^gh-ID tracking anchors
